# Prediction Market

**Prediction Market is a decentralized platform that allows users to create and participate in prediction markets on various topics using blockchain technology. This innovative solution leverages the power of smart contracts to ensure transparency, security, and trust in the prediction process.**

## User Interactions:

1. Users can claim demo prediction market tokens (PMT) to participate in active markets.
2. After claiming, users can buy yes or no shares for the active markets using prediction market tokens (PMT).
3. Once the market reaches its expiration date and is resolved, users can claim their rewards if the shares they bet on won.
4. Once the markets are expired and resolved, users can claim their rewards in the form of prediction market tokens (PMT).

## Problem

Prediction markets are often plagued by issues such as lack of transparency, manipulation, and centralization. Traditional prediction markets can be influenced by a single entity, leading to biased outcomes and reduced trust among participants. Additionally, centralized platforms are vulnerable to data breaches and censorship.

## Solution 

The primary goal of Prediction Market is to address these challenges by providing a decentralized platform where users can create and participate in prediction markets without the need for intermediaries. By leveraging blockchain technology and smart contracts, Prediction Market ensures that all transactions are transparent, secure, and immutable.

## Key Features:

- **Decentralization and Security**: All transactions are recorded on the blockchain, ensuring transparency and reducing the risk of manipulation.
- **Trustless Environment**: Smart contracts automatically execute transactions based on predefined conditions, eliminating the need for intermediaries.
- **Censorship Resistance**: The platform is not controlled by a single entity, reducing the risk of censorship.
- **Immutable Data**: Data on the blockchain remains secure and unaltered.
- **Auditability**: Transparent data transactions and smart contract interactions on the blockchain provide auditability.
